# we need to create a folder in our computer
# "setwd" means "set working directory"
# "pwd" means "print working directory" --> allows you to look at your working directory

# set the working directory based on your path:
# setwd("yourpath")
# setwd("C:\Users\Diego C\Downloads") --> this is not the real path: for Windows, you have to use normal slashes "/"
setwd("C:/Users/Diego C/Downloads")
